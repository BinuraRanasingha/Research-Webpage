					<p>Since gaining independence in 1948, the Sri Lankan economy has encountered numerous challenges. One of the most significant issues has been fiscal indiscipline, 
					leading to a substantial gap between government revenue and  expenditure, commonly referred to as the 'budget deficit.' Starting from 1990, 
					this budget deficit has seen a significant increase. In fact, according to reports from the Central Bank, since 1990, a surplus in the primary account has only been 
					achieved twice [1]. This suggests that the government's revenue is often insufficient to cover expenses, excluding interest payments, further exacerbating the budget 
					deficit.</p>
					
					<p>Tatiana Vasylieva, Sergij Lyeonov, Oleksii Lyulyov, and Kostiantyn Kyrychenko conducted a comprehensive study on the role and impact of macroeconomic stability on
					economic growth in European countries for the period spanning from 2000 to 2016 [4]. Utilizing a modified Cobb–Douglas production function, their research findings 
					concluded that a 1% improvement in macroeconomic stability has a more positive influence on GDP growth compared to foreign direct investments. This underscores the 
					importance of implementing appropriate macroeconomic policies by governments to foster economic growth in the studied countries. </p>
					
					<p>For instance, Nguyen Tung (2020) [5] investigated the effects of fiscal deficits on economic growth in an emerging economy using data from Vietnam. The study 
					employed an Error Correlation model to assess the impact of fiscal deficits on economic growth, revealing a negative and significant influence in both the short and 
					long run. Cebula (1995) [6] explored the impact of budget deficits on the U.S.economy's growth using quarterly data from 1955 to 1992 and found that budget deficits 
					led to a reduction in the economic growth rate. The study also confirmed that income tax had detrimental effects on economic growth. This implies that an increase in
					the budget deficit leads to a higher tax ratio, generating additional revenue to offset previous deficits, thereby restraining economic growth.</p>

				<h1>Research Gap</h1>
				<p>The current literature, as discussed, primarily focuses on identifying the impact of fiscal deficits or budgetary sources on macroeconomic variables such as 
				inflation and economic growth. Its goal is to comprehend the causes of macroeconomic instability and determine whether these factors have a negative or positive 
				effect on the economy. While the results of these studies do indicate whether fiscal deficits, money printing, or taxation are detrimental or beneficial to the 
				economy, they often lack a systematic approach to mitigate harm or maximize benefits. Hence, it can be argued that the current literature falls short in providing 
				systematic solutions to maintain macroeconomic stability. Therefore, there is a gap in the existing literature that needs to be filled with systematic approaches to 
				ensure and enhance macroeconomic stability. Furthermore, as we found, there are not many studies done in the Sri Lankan context when it comes to identifying the 
				impact of budgetary sources on the economy, hence there is a gap in the existing literature to come up with a study to identify the impact of budgetary sources on 
				the economy in the Sri Lankan context.

				<h1>Research Problem</h1>
				<p>The prevailing economic crisis in Sri Lanka is believed to be caused by the balance of payment issue and the macroeconomic instability resulting from the 
				substantial fiscal deficit. Consequently, in response to this crisis, the current authorities of the country have decided to negotiate a staff-level agreement with 
				the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This agreement entails a fiscal consolidation program aimed at achieving and maintaining macroeconomic stability in the short 
				and long term. It involves reducing the fiscal deficit over time and restructuring public debt. Within this program, the fiscal deficit is acknowledged as the primary
				contributor to macroeconomic instability. It's important to note that the new Central Bank Act, proposed as part of this agreement, strictly prohibits monetary 
				financing for budgetary needs, effectively closing the door on the Sri Lankan Government's ability to finance the fiscal deficit. However, as discussed in the 
				literature review, there are dissenting voices among economists who argue that the fiscal deficit may not be as detrimental as implied. Some studies in the existing 
				literature even conclude that the fiscal deficit can have a positive impact on economic growth. Additionally, it's worth noting that a majority of countries worldwide
				operate with fiscal deficits.</p>
				
				<p>Given these considerations, could there be an alternative systematic solution to achieve and sustain macroeconomic stability by approaching this crisis from a 
				different perspective? One could argue that rather than treating the fiscal deficit as an inherently negative factor, it could be considered the 'new norm.' This 
				alternative viewpoint could lead to the encouragement of borrowing, including monetary financing for budgetary purposes, rather than their exclusion.</p>
				
				<p>In this alternative approach, efforts could be made to minimize the potential risks associated with the fiscal deficit, monetary financing, borrowing, or taxation,
				as outlined in the existing literature, while maximizing the potential benefits highlighted by dissenting economists and select studies within the literature.</p>

				<h1>Research Objective</h1>
				<h2>Main Objective</h2>
				<p>This study focuses on preserving macroeconomic stability by using a systematic solution to optimize budgetary source amounts to finance government expenditure in 
				order to minimize the risk associated with it while maximizing the benefit associated with it. Hence, the identification of the optimum budgetary source amount for a
				given expenditure amount is the main objective of the study.</p>
				<br>
				<h2>Sub Objective</h2>
				<p>The budgetary source amounts have to be predicted for the following years to be optimized later. Predictive models will have to be used for this purpose. In order 
				to optimize the budgetary sources, the relationship between those and the considered macroeconomic variables has to be identified. Using the relationship, the 
				budgetary sources such as monetary financing can be optimized based on given targets. A web application has to be developed to provide a user interface to input 
				defined targets based on which the budgetary sources are optimized. </p>
